# Bitshares RPC API client for Csharp

This library is sending and receiving data to Bitshares Core API.

Documents about bitshares RPC API: http://docs.bitshares.org/api/rpc.html

Database API (accounts and some other things): http://docs.bitshares.org/api/database.html

Library Features:
- Manually create JSON data via classes
- Send JSON string to API endpoint
- Receive JSON as string and convert it to Csharp classes

Other features will implement in future. 

Note: I developed this library with Monodevelop on Ubuntu. I didn't test it on Windows and Visual Studio.
I think you can open it on Visual Studio.

Have fun.
